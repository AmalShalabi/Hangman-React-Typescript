# Hangman Game with React and TypeScript <a href="https://amalshalabi.github.io/Hangman-React-Typescript/" target="_blank">Demo</a>  

This project is a web-based Hangman game built with React and TypeScript. The game is a classic word-guessing game in which players must guess letters to fill in the blank spaces of a secret word, while trying to avoid getting "hanged" by guessing too many incorrect letters.

## Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to clone this repository onto your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/AmalShalabi/Hangman-React-Typescript.git
```
Next, navigate into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```
cd Hangman-React-Typescript.git
npm install
```
Finally, start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```
## How to Play
- The player will be presented with a secret word, represented by blank spaces for each letter.
- The player must guess a letter by clicking on one of the letter buttons on the screen.
- If the letter is present in the secret word, it will be revealed in the appropriate blank space(s).
- If the letter is not present in the secret word, a body part will be added to the hangman figure on the screen.
- The player can keep guessing letters until they either solve the word or run out of guesses and lose the game.
